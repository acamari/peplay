* arbitrary 'chord' support: multiple notes played at same time
* insert little silence at the end of each note to make them feel smoother?
* use a kind of degraded sine wave to make notes 'fade' away? exponentially
  degradation, some other kind?
* print PCM while processing notes, don't wait until all is generated, cached in
  mem
